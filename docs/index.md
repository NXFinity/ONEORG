# ONEORG PROJECT
### Revolutionizing the Future
###### Project Codename: Genesis | NXFinity

Thinking into the future, is the only way to get there. We can't keep rinse and repeating the same concepts all the time, without innovation
and forward-thinking, we will never progress. We need to think outside the box and push the boundaries of what's possible. We need to be
bold and brave, we need to be the change we want to see in the world and to do this, we need to be the change we want to see in ourselves.

ONEORG is a project that aims to change 'Rinse & Repeat', by first making it easier for users to deploy their own platforms and have a much greater
control over their data. Not only that, but you can control who has access to your solutions. Here are some examples:

### Case Example 1:
As a small business, you might need to restrict specific access to your site. You might be a 'Content Creator' and want to stop certain users from accessing
your content. By deploying your own 'ONEORG Media Engine', you can control who has access to your content and who doesn't. Our 'CDN', distributes the content
you've allowed access to and so users will also be blocked from accessing your content, if they don't have the correct permissions.

**REASONING**
- You want full control over who has access to your data.
- You want to be able to limit access to content you've created and not just your live content.
- You want to stop users from accessing your content, if they don't have the correct permissions and so blocking them fully.

By giving you control, through deployment of our BaaS/SaaS services and solutions, we aim to not only take control away from the big corporations, but to
put it back into the hands of the people.
